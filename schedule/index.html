                          <p>The following description of the <em>Joys of the Programming Craft</em> was taken from Chapter 1 of the famous book <trigger for="modal:mmm" trigger="click"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>, by Frederick P. Brooks</trigger>.</p>
                          <blockquote>
                            <p><strong>Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?</strong></p>
                            <p>First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things,
                              especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things,
                              a delight shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.</p>
                            <p>Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and
                              to find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child's
                              first clay pencil holder &quot;for Daddy's office.&quot;</p>
                            <p>Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them
                              work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The programmed computer
                              has all the fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.</p>
                            <p>Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or another
                              the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes both.</p>
                            <p>Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet,
                              works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of
                              the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand
                              conceptual structures....</p>
                            <p>Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing
                              visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms.
                              The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life,
                              showing things that never were nor could be.</p>
                            <p>Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.</p>
                          </blockquote>
                          <blockquote>
                            <p><strong>Not all is delight, however, and knowing the inherent woes makes it easier to bear them when they appear.</strong></p>
                            <p>First, one must perform perfectly. The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character,
                              one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work. Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect,
                              and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.</p>
                            <p>Next, other people set one's objectives, provide one's resources, and furnish one's information. One rarely controls the
                              circumstances of his work, or even its goal. In management terms, one's authority is not sufficient for his responsibility.
                              It seems that in all fields, however, the jobs where things get done never have formal authority commensurate with responsibility.
                              In practice, actual (as opposed to formal) authority is acquired from the very momentum of accomplishment.</p>
                            <p>The dependence upon others has a particular case that is especially painful for the system programmer. He depends upon other
                              people's programs. These are often maldesigned, poorly implemented, incompletely delivered (no source code or test cases),
                              and poorly documented. So he must spend hours studying and fixing things that in an ideal world would be complete, available, and usable.</p>
                            <p>The next woe is that designing grand concepts is fun; finding nitty little bugs is just work. With any creative activity
                              come dreary hours of tedious, painstaking labor, and programming is no exception.</p>
                            <p>Next, one finds that debugging has a linear convergence, or worse, where one somehow expects a quadratic sort of approach to the end.
                              So testing drags on and on, the last difficult bugs taking more time to find than the first.</p>
                            <p>The last woe, and sometimes the last straw, is that the product over which one has labored so long appears to be
                              obsolete upon (or before) completion. Already colleagues and competitors are in hot pursuit of new and better ideas.
                              Already the displacement of one's thought-child is not only conceived, but scheduled.</p>
                            <p>This always seems worse than it really is. The new and better product is generally not available when one completes his own;
                              it is only talked about. It, too, will require months of development. The real tiger is never a match for the paper one,
                              unless actual use is wanted. Then the virtues of reality have a satisfaction all their own.</p>
                            <p>Of course the technological base on which one builds is always advancing. As soon as one freezes a design,
                              it becomes obsolete in terms of its concepts. But implementation of real products demands phasing and quantizing.
                              The obsolescence of an implementation must be measured against other existing implementations, not against unrealized concepts.
                              The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources.</p>
                            <p>This then is programming, both a tar pit in which many efforts have floundered and a creative activity with joys
                              and woes all its own. For many, the joys far outweigh the woes....</p>

                            <p><em>The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering</em> is a book on software engineering and project management by Fred Brooks, whose central theme is that &quot;adding manpower to a late software project makes it later&quot;. This idea is known as Brooks's law, and is presented along with the second-system effect and advocacy of prototyping.</p>

                                    <p>Justify this statement: Coding is still a ‘design’ activity, not a ‘manufacturing’ activity. You may use a comparison (or an analogy) of Software engineering versus Civil Engineering to argue this point.</p>

                                      <p>Arguments to support this statement:</p>

                                        <li>If coding is a manufacturing activity, we should be able to do it using robotic machines (just like in the car industry) or low-skilled laborers (like in the construction industry).</li>
                                        <li>If coding is a manufacturing activity, we wouldn’t be changing it so much after we code software. But if the code is in fact a ‘design’, yes, we would fiddle with it until we get it right.</li>
                                        <li>Manufacturing is the process of building a finished product based on the design. Code is the design. Manufacturing is what is done by the compiler (fully automated).</li>

                          <p><strong>Professional software engineers often write code using <em>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</em>. IDEs support all development-related work within the same tool.</strong></p>
                          <p>An IDE generally consists of:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>A source code editor that includes features such as syntax coloring, auto-completion, easy code navigation, error highlighting, and code-snippet generation.</li>
                            <li>A compiler and/or an interpreter (together with other build automation support) that facilitates the compilation/linking/running/deployment of a program.</li>
                            <li>A debugger that allows the developer to execute the program one step at a time to observe the run-time behavior in order to locate bugs.</li>
                            <li>Other tools that aid various aspects of coding e.g. support for automated testing, drag-and-drop construction of UI components, version management support, simulation of the target runtime platform, and modeling support.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Examples of popular IDEs:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Java: Eclipse, Intellij IDEA, NetBeans</li>
                            <li>C#, C++: Visual Studio</li>
                            <li>Swift: XCode</li>
                            <li>Python: PyCharm</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Some Web-based IDEs have appeared in recent times too e.g., Amazon's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Cloud9 IDE</a>.</p>
                          <p>Some experienced developers, in particular those with a UNIX background, prefer lightweight yet powerful text editors with scripting capabilities (e.g. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>) over heavier IDEs.</p>

                          <p><strong>A <em>collection</em> — sometimes called a <em>container</em> — is simply an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit.</strong> Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data.</p>
                          <box>
                            <p><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Typically, collections represent data items that form a natural group, such as a poker hand (a collection of cards), a mail folder (a collection of letters), or a telephone directory (a mapping of names to phone numbers).</p>
                          </box>
                          <p><strong>The collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections.</strong> It contains the following:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              <p><strong>Interfaces</strong>: These are abstract data types that represent collections. Interfaces allow collections to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation.<br>
                                <span class="dimmed"><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Example: the <code>List&lt;E&gt;</code> interface can be used to manipulate list-like collections which may be implemented in different ways such as <code>ArrayList&lt;E&gt;</code> or <code>LinkedList&lt;E&gt;</code>.</span><br></p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <p><strong>Implementations</strong>: These are the concrete implementations of the collection interfaces. In essence, they are reusable data structures.<br>
                                <span class="dimmed"><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Example: the <code>ArrayList&lt;E&gt;</code> class implements the <code>List&lt;E&gt;</code> interface while the <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> class implements the <code>Map&lt;K, V&gt;</code> interface.</span><br></p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <p><strong>Algorithms</strong>: These are the methods that perform useful computations, such as <em>searching</em> and <em>sorting</em>, on objects that implement collection interfaces. The algorithms are said to be polymorphic: that is, the same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface.<br>
                                <span class="dimmed"><span class="fas fa-cube"></span> Example: the <code>sort(List&lt;E&gt;)</code> method can sort a collection that implements the <code>List&lt;E&gt;</code> interface.</span></p>
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                          <p><span style="opacity: 0.5"> <span class="badge badge-pill badge-success"><span class="fas fa-equals"></span></span></span> <strong>A well-known example of collections frameworks is the C++ <em>Standard Template Library (STL)</em></strong>. <span style="opacity: 0.5"> <span class="badge badge-pill badge-danger"><span class="fas fa-not-equal"></span></span></span> Although both are collections frameworks and the syntax look similar, note that there are important philosophical and implementation differences between the two.</p>
                          <p>The following list describes the core collection interfaces:</p>
                          <ul>

                              <p><strong><code>Collection</code></strong> — the root of the collection hierarchy. A collection represents a group of objects known as its elements. The Collection interface is the least common denominator that all collections implement and is used to pass collections around and to manipulate them when maximum generality is desired. Some types of collections allow duplicate elements, and others do not. Some are ordered and others are unordered. The Java platform doesn't provide any direct implementations of this interface but provides implementations of more specific subinterfaces, such as <code>Set</code> and <code>List</code>. <span class="dimmed">Also see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html"><code>Collection</code> API</a>.</span></p>

                              <p><strong><code>Set</code></strong> — a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. This interface models the mathematical set abstraction and is used to represent sets, such as the cards comprising a poker hand, the courses making up a student's schedule, or the processes running on a machine. <span class="dimmed">Also see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Set.html"><code>Set</code> API</a>.</span></p>

                              <p><strong><code>List</code></strong> — an ordered collection (sometimes called a <em>sequence</em>). <code>List</code>s can contain duplicate elements. The user of a <code>List</code> generally has precise control over where in the list each element is inserted and can access elements by their integer index (position). <span class="dimmed">Also see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/List.html"><code>List</code> API</a>.</span></p>

                              <p><strong><code>Queue</code></strong> — a collection used to hold multiple elements prior to processing. Besides basic <code>Collection</code> operations, a <code>Queue</code> provides additional insertion, extraction, and inspection operations. <span class="dimmed">Also see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html"><code>Queue</code> API</a>.</span></p>

                              <p><strong><code>Map</code></strong> — an object that maps keys to values. A <code>Map</code> cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value. <span class="dimmed">Also see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Map.html"><code>Map</code> API</a>.</span></p>

                            <p>Here is another definition of testing:</p>

                              <p>Software testing consists of the <em>dynamic</em> verification that a program provides <em>expected</em> behaviors on a <em>finite</em> set of test cases, suitably <em>selected</em> from the usually infinite execution domain. <sub>-– source: <a href="https://www.computer.org/web/swebok/v3">Software Engineering Book of Knowledge V3</a></sub></p>

                            <p>Some things to note (indicated by keywords in the above definition):</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><em>Dynamic</em>: Testing involves executing the software. It is not by examining the code statically.</li>
                              <li><em>Finite</em>: In most non-trivial cases there are potentially infinite test scenarios but resource constraints dictate that we can test only a finite number of scenarios.</li>
                              <li><em>Selected</em>: In most cases it is not possible to test all scenarios. That means we need to select what scenarios to test.</li>
                              <li><em>Expected</em>: Testing requires some knowledge of how the software is expected to behave.</li>

                          <ul>
                            <li>First, we feed the app with a sequence of test inputs that is stored in a file while redirecting the output to another file.</li>
                            <li>Next, we compare the actual output file with another file containing the expected output.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Let us assume we are testing a CLI app called <code>AddressBook</code>. Here are the detailed steps:</p>
                          <ol>
                            <li>
                              <p>Store the test input in the text file <code>input.txt</code>.</p>
                              <panel header="%%<span class='fas fa-cube'></span> Example `input.txt`%%" type="seamless">
                                <pre class="hljs"><code>add Valid Name p/12345 valid@email.butNoPrefix
add Valid Name 12345 e/valid@email.butPhonePrefixMissing

                              </panel>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <p>Store the output we expect from the SUT in another text file <code>expected.txt</code>.</p>

                              <p>Run the program as given below, which will redirect the text in <code>input.txt</code> as the input to <code>AddressBook</code> and similarly, will redirect the output of AddressBook to a text file <code>output.txt</code>. <span class="dimmed">Note that this does not require any code changes to <code>AddressBook</code>.</span></p>

                                  <p>💡 The way to run a CLI program differs based on the language.<br>
                                    e.g., In Python, assuming the code is in <code>AddressBook.py</code> file, use the command<br>
                                    <code>python AddressBook.py &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt</code></p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  <p>💡 If you are using Windows, use a normal command window to run the app, not a Power Shell window.</p>
                                </li>
                              </ul>

                                <p>A CLI program takes input from the keyboard and outputs to the console. That is because those two are default input and output streams, respectively. But you can change that behavior using <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> operators. For example, if you run <code>AddressBook</code> in a command window, the output will be shown in the console, but if you run it like this,</p>
                                <pre><code class="hljs sh">java AddressBook &gt; output.txt 
</code></pre>
                                <p>the Operating System then creates a file <code>output.txt</code> and stores the output in that file instead of displaying it in the console. No file I/O coding is required. Similarly, adding <code>&lt; input.txt</code> (or any other filename) makes the OS redirect the contents of the file as input to the program, as if the user typed the content of the file one line at a time.</p>

                              <p>Next, we compare <code>output.txt</code> with the <code>expected.txt</code>. This can be done using a utility such as Windows <code>FC</code> (i.e. File Compare) command, Unix <code>diff</code> command, or a GUI tool such as <em>WinMerge</em>.</p>

                          <p>Note that the above technique is only suitable when testing CLI apps, and only if the exact output can be predetermined. <span class="dimmed">If the output varies from one run to the other (e.g. it contains a time stamp), this technique will not work.

                                <p><strong><em>Revision control</em> is the process of managing multiple versions of a piece of information.</strong> In its simplest form, this is something that many people do by hand: every time you modify a file, save it under a new name that contains a number, each one higher than the number of the preceding version.</p>
                                <p>Manually managing multiple versions of even a single file is an error-prone task, though, so software tools to help automate this process have long been available. The earliest automated revision control tools were intended to help a single user to manage revisions of a single file. Over the past few decades, the scope of revision control tools has expanded greatly; they now manage multiple files, and help multiple people to work together. The best modern revision control tools have no problem coping with thousands of people working together on projects that consist of hundreds of thousands of files.</p>
                                <p><strong>Revision control software will track the history and evolution of your project</strong>, so you don't have to. For every change, you'll have a log of who made it; why they made it; when they made it; and what the change was.</p>
                                <p><strong>Revision control software makes it easier for you to collaborate</strong> when you're working with other people. For example, when people more or less simultaneously make potentially incompatible changes, the software will help you to identify and resolve those conflicts.</p>
                                <p><strong>It can help you to recover from mistakes</strong>. If you make a change that later turns out to be an error, you can revert to an earlier version of one or more files. In fact, a really good revision control tool will even help you to efficiently figure out exactly when a problem was introduced.</p>
                                <p><strong>It will help you to work simultaneously on, and manage the drift between, multiple versions of your project.</strong> Most of these reasons are equally valid, at least in theory, whether you're working on a project by yourself, or with a hundred other people.</p>
